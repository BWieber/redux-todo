# redux-todo

# This project was built during Udacity's React Developer course. The intial commits were a vanilla JS application using Redux. As the course goes along we develop on on Redux principles and eventually begin adding React into the application. Due to the educational nature of the application, we have a single file in an index.html -- but do not fear! As we complete this application it will become a full fledged react application.

# In order to use this application simply clone the application and open the index.html in your favorite browser.
